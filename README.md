# odin-recipes
Website to showcase my newly acquired HTML skills.

This project is a part of the Foundation Course by The Odin Project.

Here, I have made a simple website that hosts a few recipes, using only HTML. I have used the fundamentals of HTML such as making lists, linking pages, displaying images et cetera in making this site.

I have demonstrated a basic grasp of HTML, good understanding of the structure of the project/repo and publishing into Git and Git pages.
